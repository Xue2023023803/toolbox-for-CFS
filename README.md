A toolbox for psychological experiments that supports customizing procedures for CFS, b-CFS, and t-CFS paradigms. It accommodates experiments with target stimuli as dot arrays and masking stimuli as white noise. You can also customize the psychological experiment procedures needed by generating images and placing them into a specified folder. The user experience may be a bit rough, but the code comes with Chinese comments. Hopefully, this code can be of some use.
